Assigment Description

Youâ€™ll produce a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics. You should use text and comments to document your findings and answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this file should contain the following:

A single DataFrame imported from a CSV file that has a DateTimeIndex.

A risk analysis of the assets that the DataFrame contains vs. the S&P 500. This analysis should include risk-return metrics, including the daily returns, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and beta.

An evaluation of each asset that uses rolling statistics to track the risk-reward behavior over time.

You should push your final notebook to your GitHub repository so that others can review your work.
